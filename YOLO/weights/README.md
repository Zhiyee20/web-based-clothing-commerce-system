\# YOLO Model Weights



This directory is automatically generated after training a YOLO model using Google Colab.



Trained model weight files (e.g., `best.pt`, `last.pt`) are intentionally excluded from this repository due to file size constraints and repository hygiene considerations.



\## Notes

\- This folder is generated by the YOLO training process

\- Contents may vary depending on the training configuration

\- Large binary files are not suitable for inclusion in a source code repository



\## Repository Context

This repository does not manage or version control trained YOLO model weights.



The folder structure is retained only to reflect the original project layout and to indicate where trained weights would be placed during local inference or deployment.
